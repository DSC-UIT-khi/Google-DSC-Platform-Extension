### Limitations
1) It is assumed that an account having extension other than gmail is being used. (e.g XXXX@student.uet.edu.pk)
2) Only a person with Lead role is able to add the CSV file to event.
3) Try adding attendees in small batches (e.g. 50).
4) It only adds attendees to the top most event in any selected category.
